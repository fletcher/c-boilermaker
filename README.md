## How to build ##

### macOS ###

You can automatically build Xcode projects:

*	`make xcode` -- regular build
*	`make xcode-test` -- build `run_tests` to perform CuTest unit tests

The Xcode projects can then be opened in Xcode, or you can build from
the command line via `xcodebuild`.


### Other ###

*	`make` -- regular build
*	`make-test` -- build `run_tests` to perform CuTest unit tests

These steps configure a build directory, but you still have to perform
the actual compilation.  Once you perform either step above, `cd build`
or `cd build-test` and then `make` (and `./run_tests` or `ctest` or
`make test` for the unit testing variant).
