## How to build ##

### macOS ###

You can automatically build Xcode projects:

*	`make xcode` -- regular build
*	`make xcode-test` -- build `run_tests` to perform CuTest unit tests

The Xcode projects can then be opened in Xcode, or you can build from
the command line via `xcodebuild`.


### Other ###

*	`make` -- regular build
*	`make-test` -- build `run_tests` to perform CuTest unit tests

These steps configure a build directory, but you still have to perform
the actual compilation.  Once you perform either step above, `cd build`
or `cd build-test` and then `make` (and `./run_tests` or `ctest` or
`make test` for the unit testing variant).


### Storyboards ###

If you are using macOS storyboards, they need to be compiled first.
Xcode handles this automatically.  It would be possible to add this
behavior to CMake, but would add complexity for something that is
unlikely to be really necessary.

To compile you, can use a command like:

	ibtool --compile Main.storyboardc Main.storyboard
